	<div>If you're visiting this page as part of a prospect recovery test, go to <a href="/my-recoveries">My Recoveries</a> to confirm this prospect achieved "Recovered" status. Also, if you remember what your campaign or dashboard stats were before hand, you can see your recovery stats incremented by one: <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>, <a href="/my-campaigns">My campaigns</a>.</div>

	<div style="margin: 40px auto 20px; clear:both;">The only difference between this embed code and the previous page's embed code is that the completion page must have the <b>TRANSACTION_ID</b> between the apostrophes replaced with the actual transaction identification number generated by your server. The numbers <b>1092834030</b> have been placed there to give you an example of how to do it.</div>

			<h1>Why I Made the Decisions I Made When Building This</h1>
				
				
			<div class="question_title">THE GOAL OF TODAY</div>
			<div class="answer">The goal of today is to get into the panel and make sure it's working for you guys. You can only use one a limelight account once in the system. So that means www.productssecure.com can only be used once. If you only have so many accounts to use, you guys should huddle around on the same computer do it together. I want everyone to see the signup process where a bunch of messages will be displayed confirming that scraping limelight, generating your api keys, and testing them all works out properly. It will give you a sense of what's going on behind the scenes in connection with limelight. After you all see the signup process, feel free to fool around with the panel privately. If you aren't near each other, divvy up different limelight accounts to signup with. ..Also, you should use active limelight accounts that will be receiving lots of prospects. The system in realtime displays an animated popup notification each time a new prospect is discovered! I want you guys to feel what a live system feels like. So that means real campaigns. In the Products Secure account, limelight campaign 33 and 57 as seen <a href="http://snapplr.com/my3b" target="_blank">http://snapplr.com/my3b</a> are the campaigns currently receiving prospects from limelight. So create a campaign in our system, and mark those 2 campaigns as the recipient campaigns. You will be asked to choose a destination campaign. Choose any for now. Feel free to create a new one on limelight, and refresh our page to see it come up if you want. But just know you don't have to do all that. I've created a test micro-site that you can redirect email links to. So as you fill out the create campaign form and wizard, don't stress it. You will get error messages about key things I need from you, and at after you have made the campaign on the My Campaigns page you will have an option to test the campaign using the example micro-site as the destination site. In short, everything's made to work and be testable without you having to spend an hour or two creating an HTML site, copy/pasting the embed code I provide, etc. You don't have to do that. Do that tomorrow. Today, go with the flow, and if I've done a good job the system should guide you through what you need to do, and provide you with all the means necessary to test everything without having to get your hands dirty. </div>
		
		
			<div class="question_title">HOW DID THE LIME LIGHT PANEL SYNCING BECOME SO EASY?</div>
			<div class="answer">This worked out quite <a href="/images/screenshots/create_campaign.png" target="_blank">nicely</a>. What was originally like 5-6 steps became just 3 steps, and really just 2 steps. You fill out some fields and on one page you select recipient limelight campaigns and destination limelight campaigns. I.e. what where the prospects come from and where we want to send them to. The interface is intelligently setup so you can't assign one limelight campaign to more than one vortex campaign--that way prospects don't receive multiple emails to multiple destination sites. </div>
			
			
			<div class="question_title">WHAT ABOUT LIMELIGHT INTEGRATION?</div>
			<div class="answer">We can do that too. Rick said it's $1500 bucks. But it's just for marketing purposes. What he was offering with his prospect provider integration doesn't fully get us where we need to go. After enabling that on a campaign, you still need to go back to our system and configure it, and since our system can access the same prospects via the API, 3rd party api integration from a technical standpoint becomes pointless. In addition, if we were to do it fully through being a 3rd party partner, you also have to turn on the "Optimized Customer Outcome" 3rd party option. So the limelight user has to turn on 2 options. The major issue with the OCO is that then you can't also use Rev Guard. Rick said down the line they will allow multiple providers per provider type (i.e. prospect or OCO), but who's to say how long that is from now. In addition, that's another $1500 bucks. ..So my recommendation is that you pay rick to do the $1500 and get the various marketing perks that go along with it, i.e. being promoted in their documentation, etc, but we barely think about it again. If a customer wants to use it, it won't hurt. It will just be an extra step that they don't quite grasp that they don't have to do, but that can be our little secret. In reality, it's even worse than that with what Rick was offering: limelight customers must call or email in and request that a certain 3rd party provider is enabled. Providers like Revguard for instance don't just appear in the OCO dropdown--you had to contact Limelight and request it. That's a hell of a lot more work than what the system does in a lot less steps. ..Anyway, I just hope it's clear that absolutely zero value from a technical standpoint is received by being a limelight provider. So let's pay rick the $1500, get us promoted as a provider, get a mention in the limelight newsletter about us, etc, etc--generally milk it for all its worth, but while understanding it has no affect on the technical aspects. That said, in the future we should convince rick to give us a truly custom integration, not just the typical prospect provider integration he has done for many companies. I tried to push him for more, but he wasn't budging. Maybe after he sees this, he'll be more willing to do go the extra mile for us. What we need is our own dropdowns just for us, as opposed to a dropdown where you choose between us and other providers. And in our dropdown are options to choose a destination campaign to send prospects to. That's all.</div>
			
			
			<div class="question_title">WHAT ARE THE TEST/UNDO BUTTONS ON THE MY RECOVERIES PAGE ALL ABOUT?</div>
			<div class="answer">This <a href="/my-recoveries" target="_blank">feature</a> may not be something that needs to make it into the final product released to end users, but it's extremely key right now to verify our landing pages are working properly, and stats are tracking properly, etc. It allows us to test what prospects see, and the affects of their actions, without waiting for them to click on the links in our emails. This feature coupled with the flyup-notifications essentially let all parties confirm that the system is in fact working. It's tracking the user's actions properly and presenting their user information on the destination payment page and it's also accurately collecting new prospects every minute from limelight. </div>
			
			
			<div class="question_title">HOW DID THE API + SCRAPING THING PAN OUT?</div>
			<div class="answer">Very well. I built a best-of-both-worlds solution. What we do is take the user's login credentials to limelight, and then login on their behalf, and then create an api key if one doesn't already exist, and then proceed to use that API key to retrieve the latest campaigns, prospects, and customers (note: we need customers to know which prospects don't need to be sent emails). The system is built in a very robust way, so that if the limelight API key or your limelight login credentials break, you are redirected on next login (or even during your visit) to the limelight credentials page; and you can't go anywhere else in the panel until you provide the correct credentials. I've done a lot to really insure that these fundamentals don't break down--we need to be able to depend on our API requests getting prospects and customers every minute working. On login/signup (and when redirected back there if anything breaks), the user is presented with many success and error messages. If there are errors, special codes are provided which can be told to me so I can know exactly what issue people had. The goal is be able to depend on the connection between our system and limelight. If we can depend on that being solid as a rock, we can move forward and build great products like what we're looking at today. However, if it's always breaking down because we don't want to face the importance of this connection, we never get out the gate. Thats my thinking behind what I hope you get back to me and confirm is a stable and robust system.

			<div class="question_title">WHAT IS THE CAMPAIGN APPROVAL PAGE ALL ABOUT?</div>
			<div class="answer">First off, this page and any other pages we add in this second sidebar box are for admins only. I've marked all our emails as admins. So for every deployment of this platform, we will always be treated as an admin. You should create an account with a different email than your vortex emails if you want to see what the panel looks like from a regular user's perspective. In general, it just doesn't have the campaign approval page. However in addition, the account only shows campaigns, prospects, stats, etc, for that user, whereas admin accounts actually have campaigns from all users in the system. So, if you're an admin you can see everything all our clients have created in the system. ...So the <a href="admin/campaign-approval" target="_blank">Campaign Approval page</a> serves the purpose obviously for giving campaigns the final approval before we start sending emails on their behalf. We will however collect prospects even before this approval. In addition, you will see that each campaign here has a DNS and a PIXEL. The DNS page provides precise DNS records (retrieved from the Mailgun API) that we must add to our registrar. This helps increase mailgun's deliverability. Also, without it, mailgun will send no more than 300 emails per day per domain. In short, the way I got things setup here with deep automated integration with a high quality mail delivery engine is a best-in-class solution. I tried to think of everything possible to reduce the amount of work we have to when delivering on behalf of new domains. When a new campaign is created, the from address is checked, and if the domain is new, a new domain is programmatically created in Mailgun via its API. From there, we get the DNS records we need to add, and I store them in our database for display to the admins on the Campaign Approval > DNS page. If the domain already exists in our system, i retrieve those DNS records we already have and associate them with the new domain. ..As for the tracking pixel, the idea is i discerned that pasting an iframe is the most flexible solution. At first I thought we might need the cake marketing API. However, after researching the cake marketing panel, I saw how they were allowing essentially iframe pixels to be embedded within iframe pixels. So similarly, you can provide an iframe pixel, and put a token for where the TRANSACTION_ID should go. Then later on the completion page of the transaction, I inject the pixel you provided, and replace the TRANSACTION_ID token with the transaction id passed to us by whoever embeds our javascript.</div>
			
			
			<div class="question_title">ON THE FINAL STEP OF THE CREATE SEQUENCE, TELL ME ABOUT THE TUTORIAL LINK??</div>
			<div class="answer">That tutorial uses the same 2 page micro-site used for testing links sent to prospects. It's where you go to when you click the TEST button on prospect rows in the My Recoveries page. In fact, the micro-site was originally made for the purpose of describing how to use the embed code. So it's pretty explanatory. Here's a quick link to it if you're not sure what I'm talking about: <a href="/example/page-1" target="_blank">Embed Tutorial</a>. Bottom line is I made the process as easy as possible for the code that must be added to the recovery destination campaigns. It's just a javascript &ltscript&gt tag that must be added to both the step 1 payment page and the step 2 completion page. On the completion page, the transaction ID should be inserted. It's not necessary for my embedded javascript code to function, but in spirit of how all these affiliate marketing systems work I figured we should start off on a good fight and be sure to collect the all important only means of verifying we did in fact take part in a transaction. As the platform grows in features and becomes more real in various ways, I'm sure we'll eventually put it to use.</div>
			
			
			<div class="question_title">GOING FORWARD</div>
			<div class="answer">So as with all initial launches, deployments for testing, etc, the platform always seems solid, then you release it and find tons of bugs you didn't think of. I think the overall user experience is rock solid, i've gotten as many bugs as I can on my own, and you will definitely find issues. However, at this point, I can fix them lightning fast. The following is the issues I need you guys to look out for: perfect stat tracking (i.e. all the numbers on the site should increment perfectly), catching of all prospects and email delivery + notifications within our site displaying (their purpose is so we can feel the system without having to receive the emails that go to the prospects), and customer finding (customers should not be emailed, i.e. if a prospect becomes a customer before the window ends, after which he receives an email). </div>
			
			
			<div class="question_title">MY MO</div>
			<div class="answer">So bottom line with me is I like to work in a very specific environment--one where my clients trust my comprehensiveness and sense of the product at every granular level. To me, the definition of a quality interface between 2 layers within an organization is when the higher up layer (i.e. you guys, the client) can give very general abstract instructions, and then the lower layer (i.e. me, the developer) can figure out every detail in perfect coordination with what the big picture would dictate it should be. This is as opposed to having to micromanage to get it right, or as opposed to giving big picture directions and the developer just dont get it. I aim to provide the perfect interface between these 2 layers where you can be as general as possible and not worry about having to micro-manage. That's why I put so much work into this panel to make a truly complete platform. My hope is going forward we do lots of good business--business where you can sleep at night knowing your in good hands, and where I too can sleep at night knowing I don't have a client on my hands that is wrongfully mistrusting me. And where generally I can be creative and come up with sick concepts that will hit the nail on the head. I like to run a tight ship, and am both a coder and product startup entrepreneur myself--that means I'm the precise opposite of your typical coder in eastern Europe or India. Tell me a nugget of an idea, and I'm on top of product like no other--i have a wealth of experience in building web products to completion that I can draw on to craft you the perfect solution after cross-referencing everything I've ever seen or built in my head. For many of my clients I recommend complete startup niches we should approach, and for almost all of my clients I lead product, not just code. Through internal vertical integration within myself, I'm able to come up with the best features that are also easiest to code. Rather than amazing features that take forever to code, which happens when non-technical product guys lead. In short, I find the path of least resistance. ..Anyway, this is our first project together. I hope you like what you see. I think there is a lot of potential to grow this into something a lot more than what it starts as. I already have in mind a navigation user experience in mind for navigating through a lot more/pages and features. Basically, we have a mint colored site here, but in the left sidebar under the logo there could be a custom dropdown to navigate between products. This is our recovery product. It's mint colored. Say, we have a real time metrics product. It's red colored. etc. We can grow this panel into a staple of the affiliate marketing industry, or perhaps the online marketing/advertising industry in general. I've built a foundation with all that in mind. It's highly extensible. It's not just hacked together code to get an initial paycheck. It's code i spent additional time on to be prepared for a better future. Lastly, this platform was built with the emerging <a href="http://www.meteor.com" target="_blank">Meteor realtime framework</a>. So whatever we do, where we will kill it is via providing realtime metrics, or any sort of realtime information that benefits from not having to refresh a page. </div>
